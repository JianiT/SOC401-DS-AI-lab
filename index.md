# How can we use CCTVs to control the crime rate in Seattle? 


## Executive Summary

The crime rate was consistently high in the downtown area and international district for the past few years. Addressing this problem is the key point of improving the crime rate in Seattle. City of Seattle want to reduce the crime rate of Seattle by installing a closed-circuit television system (CCTV) working together with Real Time Crime Center (RTCC) and Residential Camera Registry (RCR) on the certain area with high crime rate. 

Current crime data and rent data around the neighborhood installing the cameras has been analyzed for the effect of this program. There is observation that crime rate rise during the first-year implementation. The rent data have no significant difference over this period. 

Other than the change of crime rate, using CCTV also becomes a concern of privacy for citizens, residents in this area and homeless people. Citizens would be recorded during their everyday activities in the area, with the worries of personal data being retrieved by Seattle Police Department (SPD) through discretion on exaggerated crimes. Residents and homeless in these neighborhoods have more chance of being traced about their daily life and routine. 

The recommendations are about observing long term results for CCTV program to collect sufficient data for analysis, protecting the privacy of residents for daily routine, set up monitoring board for restricting the discretion of SPD, privacy protection for the reuse of footage in residential camera registry program.

Current crime data only shows that there is clearly rise in the crime rate after installing the CCTV in the certain area. Through the Case Study from McLean et al. in Schenectady, New York (2013), we can learn that the building-mount cameras with low visibility observed increase total crime number. From our analysis of Seattle’s crime data, it has the trend of increasing in the short term of one year, which might cause by the low visibility of the cameras. More crimes being noticed through the CCTV than before since the criminals did not notice about the existence or seeing scale of the camera. There is the chance that CCTV has not yet created a deterrence effect on criminals.
Both Case Study of Mexico City from Vilalta et al. (2019) and Newark from Piza et al. (2025) shows the evidence of “sleeper effect” (Holmes, 2013), which transits from short-term performance (1-2 years) to intermediate term performance (3-4 years). It shows that CCTV should be operating for longer term to show significant deterrence effect on the crime rate. As a result, the effect of CCTV system would become more evident over a longer period of observation. After the offenders learn about the camera locations, their movements of performing crime tends to decrease due to the deterrence effect.

Based on the rent data, the price for housing do not have seemingly change. There is no significant difference in the price of the neighborhood by unit or by square feet. The comparison between rent in this period cannot show if the safety has become better or any concerns about the privacy after operating the CCTV system. Further analysis can be conducted while there is long term data for the housing price change to identify the living quality and experience of the residents in those neighborhoods.
