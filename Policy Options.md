**Policy Options and Recommandation**

Current crime data only shows that there is clearly rise in the crime rate after installing the CCTV in the certain area. This might cause by sleeper effect that CCTV program has only started for a year with less deterrence effect on the criminals. Also, the rent data has no clear change on the rent price over this period. Current data cannot support any analysis for resident’s experience in this neighborhood. To address those issues, City of Seattle should carry out a longer period to observe the long-term difference of crime rate like Newark’s evaluation (Piza et al., 2025). If the crime rate has positive results, the government should plan for more installation on the area with relatively high crime rate like how they increased camera for Capitol Hill (Dalgetty, 2025). In the case of Piza et al. (2025), there is potential displacement effect for CCTV system for long term performance on the nearby areas. Hence, City of Seattle should also be mindful about the potential increase of crime rate on nearby neighborhood without CCTV. 

Recommend policy would focus on reducing some concerns for the privacy concerns of citizens. The privacy concerns of residents in the surveillance neighborhood can be solved by similar AI technology designed under the “data minimization” principles of General Data protection Regulation (GDPR) of European Union (Deldoul, 2023). This AI can be used to blur faces and license plates in CCTV footage. The data collection of unrelative people would be reduced in this footage. It can also help people lessen the burden of walking around under the camera. Since license plates are identifier for the car drivers, blurring of license plates would protect individuals from unauthorized access for those data. This can be helpful for the privacy in daily life of citizens.

To prevent from discretion of accessing the footage from SPD, there should be regular publish of data access used on footage by cases to the public for monitored. Community members can participate into the supervising process to ensure their privacy was not being violated. The City of Seattle should establish boards including SPD, privacy experts and community delegates for monitoring different evidence for access of the footages. They should also oversee responding the complaints for privacy related usage of the data. 

The City of Seattle should also have blurring and mask for the parts that are irrelevant to the case in the shared data from private cameras in RCRP. The camera owners should be able to drop out whenever they want and provide the access when there is a need being explained (City of Shreveport, 2024). Like the policy of City of Shreveport RTCC, business with street facing cameras should get compensation for device fee based on how many cameras they can shared (City of Shreveport, 2024). They can choose to unplug the wire for situations that they unwilling to share the data.
