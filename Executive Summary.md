---


City of Seattle started using CCTV and RTCC from Crime Prevention Technology Pilot to improve the crime rate in Oct 2024 (Craighead, 2024). The first targeted neighborhoods are around Aurora Avenue North, the downtown Third Avenue corridor, and the Chinatown-International District. Main concerns of the CCTV and RTCC are privacy issues and if it is worth spending the funds and efforts on the CCTV. There is also Residential Camera Registry (RCR) program for SPD accessing private camera after consent from the owner to help with law enforcement department (Connect Seattle, 2025).

CCTV and RTCC help police identify and record more crimes. Based on the Police would be easier to get more evidence and information for crimes and ensure the safety of the area. Police have more access to different data with discretion in some cases, which creates more concerns from the community of unnecessary use of data with more potential of leaking citizen’s privacy information. 

CCTV would be a monitor to protect people from minor crimes and find criminals for the crimes has been done. Citizens can expect a better living environment with less worried about their safety. CCTV around the living area is also a potential risk for personal privacy. Residents and homeless living near the areas would need to be careful about being recorded of their behaviors in their neighborhood. Although based on the policy of the CCTV program, the cameras would mostly face public area and there will be mask on private area that has been recorded (Seattle Police Department, 2021). However, the appearance of people in public sector of life can also becoming a violation of privacy. For example, the activity that individual held, events that they participated in, their social network that connected with them, and their daily routine would be exposed under the surveillance. This is an essential problem that most citizens worried, which also lead to petition for against of CCTV and RTCC program (Action Network, 2025). Since the information shared in RCR would be publicly disclosed after the investigation of SPD. The chance of private information leaking is becoming an essential issue (Connect Seattle, 2025).
